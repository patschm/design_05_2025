# Using foreach
## Introduction
In this exercise we have a custom collection (SpecialCollection<T>) wrapping an array that duplicates in size each time it reaches its capacity.
The problem is that we cannot blindly navigate through the collection since many array elements might be empty (null) which makes looping through the collection error prone.
How can we solve this problem? And how can we solve it such that the collection can be used in a foreach statement?
### Exercise 1
What design pattern do you recommend?
### Exercise 2

### Exercise 3 (Optional. If time permits)
Open [Starter\Patterns.sln](Starter/Patterns.sln).
Try to implement the design pattern.
