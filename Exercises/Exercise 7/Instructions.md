# In the media
## Introduction
You received an implementation for media components. The components are:
- Amplifier
- MoviePlayer
- MusicPlayer
- PodcastPlayer
- TVPlayer
All these players use a PaymentService to buy content.
The current implementation is pretty intimidating and requires some knowledge. (See [Starter/Exercise.sln](/Starter/Exercise.sln))
### Exercise 1
What design pattern would you recommend instead and why?
### Exercise 3
Sketch a class diagram for this program based on your recommended pattern.
### Exercise 3 (Optional. If time permits)
Open [Starter/Exercise.sln](/Starter/Exercise.sln).
